After Sputnik, Eisenhower wanted a dedicated, cross-departmental division within
the US government to focus on advanced technological research so that they would
not be caught out again. ARPA was the result.

Originally under the control of the Department of Defence (Pentagon).

Once projects reached maturity, they would be handed over to the armed forces.

It's name switched back and forth between ARPA/DARPA depending on congressional
factors and funding. The switch to DARPA (and the associated re-focusing on
military applications) indirectly precipitated a brain-drain in the late 1970s
which contributed to the birth of the personal computer around the same time.

Main technologies it contributed to or invented include the #ARPANET,
time-sharing and GPS systems.
