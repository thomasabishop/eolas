Being asked to express a natural number as a fraction seems confusing at first
but you need to just know that for any whole number $n$, you express it as a
fraction with $\frac{n}{1}$.

_Express 8 as an equivalent fraction having the denominator 5_

$$
8 = \frac{8}{1} = \frac{8 \cdot 5}{1 \cdot 5} = \frac{40}{5}
$$
