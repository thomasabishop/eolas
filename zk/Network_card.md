# Network_card

The network card (technically know as the Network Interface Card (NIC)) or
_network adapter_ is the hardware device that allows a computer to connect to a
network.

They are the physical interface between the computer and the network
[link](./Link_Layer_of_Internet_Protocol.md), e.g. WiFi or ethernet.

They can be internal and built into the [motherboard](./Motherboard.md) or
external as in the case of USB adaptors.

Each network card has a unique [MAC address](./MAC_addresses.md) to identify the
device on the network.

Network cards on consumer-grade devices typically utilise the devices resources
and the kernel manages its actions via a driver. More high-end devices
(typically used in servers) have their own processors and memory.
