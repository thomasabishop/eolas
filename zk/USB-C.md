# USB-C

The "C" in the name refers to the shape of the _connector_ not the protocol that
is used for the data transfer. (This is the case for all USB "types" which makes
things confusing.)

Multiple protocols can use the same connector for input/output. For instance
Thunderbolt can transfer over USB-C but not every port that can fit a USB-C is a
Thunderbolt port. The device's internal hardware determines the protocols
available.

The USB-C connector can serve all of the following protocols (from slowest to
fastest):

- USB 1.0 (12mb/s)
- USB 2.0 (480Mb/s)
- USB 3.0 (5Gb/s)
- USB 3.1 (10Gb/s)
- USB 3.2 (20Gb/s)
- USB 4 (40Gb/s)
- Thunderbolt (40Gb/s)

A USB-C connector is equipped to just charge a device as well as transfer data.

The world is converging (often due to legislation) on USB-C as the global
standard. It can be one connector for all existing protocols and future
protocols (for about 15 years). Its physical design an form factor can support
future advancements whilst using the same connector.

Ultimately USB-C will be surpassed by more another yet more advanced connector
and associated protocols but for the time being we can stop using the older
models.
