# a247fa9b_surveillance_capitalism_not_necessary

_Surveillance capitalism is neither a necessary development of information
capitalism nor a necessary product of digital technology or the internet. It is
a specifically constructed human choice, an unprecedented market form, an
original solution to an emergency, and the underlying mechanism through which a
new asset class is created on the cheap and converted to revenue._

_The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ (2019): 91
