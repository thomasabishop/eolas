# Batch processing

With modern computer systems programs can be executed continuously and as
needed. With earlier computers (e.g. mainframes or mini-computers that were
shared by multiple users throughout an organisation) operating on this basis
would be expensive and would squander resources. It would also be inefficient
because computers needed time to warm up and cool down between operations.

Batch processing meant waiting until the required data for the operation met a
certain volume or threshold and then running the job. This way all the computer
resources were used at once instead repeatedly over an extended period.

Running operations in batch rather than in real-time also meant you could time
when you used the computer, running your jobs during off-peak hours when more
resources would be available. Particularly beneficial during the era of
time-sharing.
