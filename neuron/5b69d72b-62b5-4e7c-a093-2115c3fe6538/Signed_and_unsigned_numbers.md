# Signed and unsigned numbers

## Summary

- To represent negative integers in binary we use signed numbers._Signed binary_
  includes negative integers, _unsigned binary_ does not.

- There are different methods of implementing the encoding of signed numbers.
  Two prominant approaches are **two's complement** and **signed magnitude
  representation**.
