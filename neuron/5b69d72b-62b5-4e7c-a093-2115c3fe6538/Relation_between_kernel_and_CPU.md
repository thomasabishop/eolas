# Relation between the kernel and CPU

It can be confusing to understand how the kernel and CPU interact with one
another. Whilst it is true to say the kernel mediates between the hardware and
user processes, this led me to think that the kernel was somehow 'over and
above' the actions of the CPU. This is wrong and if you think about it, how
could this be since any process, kernel included, requires the processor? The
kernel is executed by and loaded into the CPU just like any other instruction in
the
[fetch, decode, execute cycle](Fetch_decode_execute.md)
of the CPU.

However as a process, the kernel is the 'first amongst equals' given that it is
the core embodiment of the operating system. At boot time, the kernel is
injected into memory and at this point the CPU _looks to this address_ in memory
in order to source its first instruction. That's how the kernel gets going. It
is the first instruction that the CPU fetches and this is what allows the kernel
to play its mediatory role. However most of the fetch, decode, execute cycles of
the CPU take place independently of the kernel.

This is because of [context switching](), when the CPU is running its cycle, the
kernel is idle waiting for it to complete. Once control switches back to the
kernel it can then run its next duty which will be either process, memory or
device management or system calls. Then it will hand control over to either the
processor or user space.
