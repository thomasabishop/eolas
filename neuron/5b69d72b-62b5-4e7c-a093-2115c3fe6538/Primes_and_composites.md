# Prime and composite numbers

Definition of a **prime number**:

> For any whole number $n$ where $n \neq 1$, $n$ is prime if and only if its
> sole [factors](Factors%20and%20divisors.md) are $1$ and $n$

Definition of a **composite number**:

> For any whole number $n$, $n$ is composite just if $n$ is not prime
