# Bolt, Beranek and Newman

![BBN logo](static/bbn-logo.png)

Founded by Bolt and Beranek, two MIT students and hired some of the leading
scientists of the day to lead departments. E.g. J.C.R Licklider, John McCarthy
and Marvin Minsky.

- Tested the original prototype of the PDP-1 on behalf of DEC.
- Working for BBN, McCarthy developed one of the first time-sharing systems (the
  "BBN Time-Sharing System") for the PDP-1 provided by DEC.
- Sponsored by DARPA to create the IMP computers which served as the main
  routers of the ARPANET.

Eventually subsumed into Raytheon and now known as "Raytheon BBN".
