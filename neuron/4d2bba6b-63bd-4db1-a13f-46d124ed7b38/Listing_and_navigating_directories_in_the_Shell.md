# Listing and navigating directories in the shell

## Listing options

Obviously we know that in order to list the files and sub-directories in our
current directory we use `ls` but here are some of the most useful of the
different modifiers:

- `**ls -a**`
  - list and include hidden dot files
- `**ls -l**`
  - list with user permissions, file-size and date-modified (most detailed)
- `**ls ***`
  - list organised by folders one level deep

## Navigation shorthands

- `cd -`
  - Return to the directory you were last in
- `!!`
  - Repeat the last command
