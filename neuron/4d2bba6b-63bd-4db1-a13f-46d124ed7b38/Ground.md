# Ground

The term 'ground' is used as a general reference for 'zero potential': the point
in an electrical circuit where there is no potential difference between the
positive and negative terminals of the voltage source.

As a consequence of the lack of potential, ground is a point at which no current
can be generated.

The term originates from domestic electrical systems where the circuit box is
literally attached to the ground (represented by the green and yellow ribboned
wires in plug sockets and light fixtures etc) where current is discharged to
prevent appliances emitting electrical shocks.

In circuit diagrams with simple DC current, ground is taken to be the negative
terminal of the voltage source.
