# e383b8b3_nginx_vs_traefik

Both nginx and traefik are server technologies (along with Apache), nginx has a
longer pedigree but traefik is calibrated for more modern microservice-based
architectures (i.e Docker containers). nginx is better suited to traditional
static web-based hosting.

traefik has support for [HTTPS](HTTPS.md) natively whereas nginx requires a
plugin.
