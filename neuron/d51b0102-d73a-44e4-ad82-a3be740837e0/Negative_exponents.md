# Negative exponents

When calculating the exponents of a negative number the answer will always will
be positive:

$$
-5^2 = 25
$$

This confused me but it was because I was thinking of it in terms of
$-5 \cdot 5$ when in fact it is $-5 \cdot -5$ and when two negative numbers are
multiplied the product is always negative.
