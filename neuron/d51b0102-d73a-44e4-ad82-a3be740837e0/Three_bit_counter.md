# 3-bit Counter

To demonstrate the use of
[Flip-Flops](Flip_flops.md) we will
create the circuit for a 3-bit counter. This simply counts up from 0 to 7
because 7 is the maximum decimal number we can create with three bits ($2^3$):

| Binary | Decimal |
| ------ | ------- |
| 000    | 0       |
| 001    | 1       |
| 010    | 2       |
| 011    | 3       |
| 100    | 4       |
| 101    | 5       |
| 110    | 6       |
| 111    | 7       |

The circuit will have three memory components, each representing one bit of the
3-bit number. When the
[clock pulses](Clock_signals.md), the
3-bit number increments by one. We need to synchronise the operation with a
clock because each bit by itself is meaningless, it only gains meaning by the
relation it sustains to the other two bits hence it must be kept in sync with
them.

We can derive the circuit arrangement by analysing the outputs of a flipflop at
each pulse:

| Combined bits | Q2  | Q1  | Q0  | Decimal |
| ------------- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| 000           | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 001           | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1       |
| 010           | 0   | 1   | 0   | 2       |
| 011           | 0   | 1   | 1   | 3       |
| 100           | 1   | 0   | 0   | 4       |
| 101           | 1   | 0   | 1   | 5       |
| 110           | 1   | 1   | 0   | 6       |
| 111           | 1   | 1   | 1   | 7       |

If we look at the pattern of each flip-flops' output we notice the following:

- _Q0_ toggles on every pulse
- _Q1_ toggles every time _Q0_ was previously 1
- _Q2_ toggles when both _Q1_ and _Q0_ were previously 1

This means that to construct a circuit that displays this behaviour we just have
to use a
[T flip-flop](Flip_flops.md#t-flip-flops)
since the only state change we need is a single bit toggle three times that
retains its value.

Using these pulse patterns we can construct a circuit as follows:

This is how the circuit works:

- All three flip-flops are connected to the same clock signal so that they are
  synchnonised
- Because _T0_ is connected to the voltage source _Q0_ toggles every time the
  clock pulses
- _T1_ is connected to _Q0_ so a clock pulse causes _Q1_ to toggle only when
  _Q0_ is high in line with the table
- _T2_ is connected to _Q0 AND Q1_ so _Q2_ only toggles on a clock pulse when
  _Q0_ and _Q1_ are both high
