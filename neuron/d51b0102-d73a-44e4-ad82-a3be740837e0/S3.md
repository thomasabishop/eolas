# S3

You can think of S3 as an external mounted harddrive for storing raw binary data
(images, soundfiles, documents etc).

Your use of the S3 service is divided up into **buckets**. Buckets contain files
and resources. These are just resource names in an online container, the data
doesn't have any structure beyond that.

The primary use of S3 is to store resources that an application needs and/or to
facilitate the uploading and downloading of resources to and from an
application.

You can set access and authentication conditions for buckets, making the data
public or restricted.
