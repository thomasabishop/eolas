# Format specifiers in C

Format specifiers define the type of data to be printed on standard output. You
need to use format specifiers whenever you are
[printing-values-in-c](printing-values-in-c.md).

| Specifier | Usage                      |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| `%c`      | single character           |
| `%s`      | string                     |
| `%n`      | nothing                    |
| `%d`      | integer (assuming base 10) |
| `%f`      | float                      |
| `%%`      | The percent sign itself    |
