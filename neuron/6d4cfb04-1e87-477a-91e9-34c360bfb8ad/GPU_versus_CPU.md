# GPU versus CPU

- GPU stands for _Graphics Processing Unit_. Originally designed for rendering
  graphics and video but now used for other applications of parallel computing
  eg. machine learning.

- The standard CPU uses sequential processing whereas the GPU is designed for
  parallel processing, specialising in performing many simple calculations
  simultaneously.

- Harnessing the GPU requires specialised programming approaches.

- Most standard laptops and desktops (if they are not designed for
  graphically-intensive tasks) incorporate graphics processing within the CPU.
  The CPU chip is on the same chip as the CPU chip. This is called _integrated_
  graphics processing.

- Some laptops, especially those marketed for gaming or professional work, have
  a separate GPU chip. This is a more powerful graphics processor, separate from
  the CPU.
