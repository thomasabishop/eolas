When the microphone captures alterations in sound pressure and converts it into
an electric signal, we have a scenario where the same formal or mathematical
relationships in the phenomena (amplitude, frequency, wavelength) are being
expressed in two different modes of matter.

This is quite profound especially as the resulting electrical waveform is
_identical_ to the original sound wave. This is effectively what enables
accurate playback. We can convert between the two mediums seamlessly providing
we captured their initial expression accurately.

It's like two different people doing the same dance:

In air:

- The dancers are air molecules
- They move back and forth in waves of compression and rarefaction
- Their "dance pattern" is the sound wave

In wire:

- The dancers are electrons
- They move back and forth creating waves of voltage
- They perform the exact same "dance pattern"
