# Memory leaks

A memory leak occurs when you program memory and forget to delete it once you
are finished. The consequences of memory leak is that it reduces the performance
of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory. Eventually, in the
worst case, too much of the available memory may become allocated and all or
part of the system or device stops working correctly, the application fails, or
the system slows down vastly.
