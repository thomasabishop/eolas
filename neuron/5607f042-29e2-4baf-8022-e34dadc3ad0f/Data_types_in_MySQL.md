# Data types in MySQL

An understanding of the differences between data types is important because it
obviously affects the amount of memory the database uses.

## Numeric

### Integer (`INT`)

- No fractional part, fixed number of digits
- `TINYINT`, `BIGINT` etc are all instances of `INT`, the difference is the size
  of the number stored.

### Fixed point (`DECIMAL`)

Contains decimal point. Use when accuracy is more important that representing
very large or very small values. Hence you would use this for monetary amounts.

### Floating point (`FLOAT`)

Contains decimal point. Use when the ability to represent very large and very
small values is more important than precision. Hence you would not use this for
monetary amounts.

## String

### Fixed-length character strings ()

Spaces are stripped in storage but represented with a character set.

An example would be `CHAR(10)` or `CHAR(3)`. Here we set the upper limit but it
must be the case that no string exceeds it. For either of these, if you add a
value that is, e.g, two characters in length, it will add spaces to pad it out
and make up the upper limit.

### Variable-length character strings

As above but allowing for variable-length strings.

A common example is `VARCHAR(255)`. The 255 refers to the maximal character
length, not the byte length. It is the largest number of characters that can be
accommodated by an 8-bit number (byte). We must put `255` as the parameter even
if our character lengths will be below this but where we don't know the minimum
and maximum length.

## Large object storage

### Blob

For storing images, audio and other binary media. Variants: `TINYBLOB`, `BLOB`,
`MEDIUMBLOB` `LONGBLOB`

### Text

Like blob but has character set Variants: `TINYTEXT`, `TEXT`, `MEDIUMTEXT`,
`LONGTEXT`

## Date and time

- `DATE`
- `DATETIME`
- `TIMESTAMP`

## Speciality

### Enumerations

- `ENUM`: a single value from a list
- `SET`: several values from a list

## Storage limits

Each row can have a maximum of 65,535 bytes.
