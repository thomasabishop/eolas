# Connect to a database with Mongoose

Now that we have installed and configured MongoDB, we need to connect to it via
Node.js. Mongoose is a simple API for interacting with a Mongo database via
Node.

With Mongoose installed we can connect to a database. We don't have any Mongo
databases yet beyond the defaults but the following Mongoose connection logic
will create and connect to a new database called `playground`:

Providing the Mongo server is running (execture `mongod`), we will see the
confirmation message in the console.

```js
mongoose
  .connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1/playground")
  .then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```
