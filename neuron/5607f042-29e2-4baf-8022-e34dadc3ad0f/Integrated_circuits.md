# Integrated circuits

An integrated circuit (IC) is a single unit that comprises several logic gates
designed for the easy construction of [digital circuits](Digital_circuits.md).
The terms "integrated circuit" and "chip" are often used interchangeably.

An IC puts the gates on a single piece of silicon that has electrical contact
points called pins. There are two types of pins on an IC: input pins and output
pins. Input pins are used to receive signals from other components in the
circuit, while output pins are used to send signals to other components. The
function of a pin is determined by the connection it has to the rest of the
circuit and the type of signal it is intended to transmit or receive.

The type we will look at are called **dual in-line packages** (DIPs). They are
rectangular wth two parallel rows of pins. The pins make it easy to connect DIPs
to a breadboard.
