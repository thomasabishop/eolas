# Clock signals

In the examples of digital circuits so far (i.e
[adders](Half_adder_and_full_adder.md)
and [latches](Latches.md)) everything
happens in a single instant or over several repeated instances. This is because
of how simple the circuits are. In the case of latches only a single bit is
updated. And even with rippled adders they are just a series of 1-bit updaters
in a chain.

With more complex circuits that use multiple memory devices which store a series
of bits at once, we need a way to ensure that the bits are set at the same time.
We do this by sequencing the execution with the pulses of the system clock.

A single iteration of the volatage rising and falling is a **pulse**. A complete
oscillation from low to high and back to low is a **cycle**. As with all
[electromagnetic](Electromagnetism.md)
signals we measure the frequency of the wave in Hertz: cylcles per second. We
also further distinguish the rising and falling edge of a pulse. Rising
represents the signal passing from ground to its maximum voltage and falling is
the reverse (the electrons moving from the voltage source to ground).

The diagram below shows a pulse cycle of 2Hz.

## Linking components to the clock

- All components that need to be synchronised are connected to the clock
- State changes in the component occur only when a clock pulse occurs
- Clock-driven components will typically trigger their state changes on either
  the rising edge or the falling edge of the pulse.
- Components that trigger state changes on the rising pulse are **positive
  edge-triggered**
- Components that trigger state changes on the falling pulse are **negative
  edge-triggered**

The role of the clock is essential in the functioning of the
[CPU](CPU_architecture.md#the-system-clock). It is
the system clock that gives CPUs their performance rating: how many processes
can execute within a given clock cycle.
