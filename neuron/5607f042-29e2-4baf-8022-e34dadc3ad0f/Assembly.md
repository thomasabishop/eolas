# Assembly

- Assembly is one level up from machine code and provides a more human-friendly
  abstraction layer

- An assembly instruction is a _mneumonic_ that comprises an "op code" plus
  operands

- It is translated back to machine code by an assembler for the computer to
  execute.

## Example instruction

We can translate the machine instruction `e3a07004` into the assembly
instruction `mov r7, #4`. This translates to: _move the value number 4 to the
register r7_.

## Assemblers

Although assembly is useful for humans, computers still work at the level of
machine code. Therefore you need an **assembler** to translate the assembly code
to machine code. An assembly language text file is fed into an assembler and a
binary object file containing machine code is returned.

A disassembler does the opposite: translate machine code into assembly.

## Relation to instruction set architectures

- the ISA defines the hardware capabilities and the instructions that can be run
  on the hardware
- machine code is a binary representation of these instructions and can be
  directly executed by the CPU
- humans use an assembly language version of the machine code which is then
  translated back to machine code for the computer to execute.
