# Primitive types

The most basic type level is the one already present in JavaScript itself: the
primitive data types: `boolean`, `string` and `number` . These are the types
that would be returned from a `typeof` expression in ordinary JavaScript

## Type inference

You can explicitly declare these data types yourself when you create a variable
with `var`, `const`, or `let` if you like, but it is generally unnecessary since
Typescript is intelligent enough to perform **type inference** and will know
from what you write which type you mean.

```ts
const age: number = 32;
const name: string = "Thomas";
const one: boolean = true;
const zero: boolean = false;
```

## Arrays

With arrays that you directly define the type will also be inferred but it can
be helpful to explicitly declare them. If you declare an empty array, it is
necessary to assign empty brackets.

```ts
const store: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; // Populated array
const store: string[] = []; // Empty array
```

## Object

`Object` is a valid type declaration in TS but it is not particularly helpful
since it becomes similar to using [any](Any.md) given that most primitive
types in JavaScripts prototypically inherit from an Object.

Generally, when you use objects in TypeScript you type them as
[custom types](Custom_types_in_TypeScript.md).

## Array of (untyped) objects

If we just know that it is going to be an array of objects we can use:

```ts
const arrOfObj = {}[]
```

If we wish to define a particular shape but without defining a type:

```ts
const arrOfObj = { name: string, age: number }[]
```

But better for reusability to do:

```ts
type ArrayOfObj = {
  name: string,
  age: number
}

const arrOfObj: ArrayOfObj[] = [{}, ...]

```
