# Bauman quote

_The yawning gap between the right of self-assertion and the capacity to control
the social settings which render such self-assertion feasible. It is from that
abysmal gap that the most poisonous effluvia contaminating the lives of
contemporary individuals emanate_.

Quoted in _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ (2019): 45
