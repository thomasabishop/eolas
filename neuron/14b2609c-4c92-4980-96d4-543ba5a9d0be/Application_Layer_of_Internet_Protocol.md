# Application Layer of the Internet Protocol

The final, topmost layer of the Internet Protocol suite.

The Application Layer is where we get to the protocols that describe the
behaviour of applications. All the preceding lower levels are effectively
**plumbing that enables applications to do the things they want accross the
internet**.

Whereas the lower levels facilitate communication accross the internet, the
Application Layer is concerned with achieving a specific task once the ability
to communicate is assured.

Application Layer protocols include HTTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP), and FTP.
