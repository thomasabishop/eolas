# AWS Lambda programming model

The overall architecure consists in the following three processes:

1. Triggers
2. Handler function
3. Code

## Triggers

See [AWS Lambda triggers](Lambda_triggers.md)

## Handler function

See
[AWS Lambda handler function](Lambda_handler_function.md)

## Code

This is just the stuff that runs in the body of the handler or that is called
from the handler body.
