# Ohm's Law

The relationship between
[current](Current.md),
[voltage](Voltage.md), and
[resistance](Resistance.md) is
defined by Ohm's Law:

> The current flowing from one point to another is equal to the voltage accross
> these points divided by the resistance between them.

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

As an application, consider a circuit with a 9V battery with a 10,000 $\Omega$
resistor attached across its terminals.

The current flowing through the resistor can be calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{9V} {10,000\Omega} = 0.0009 \textsf{A} (0.9 \textsf{mA})
$$
