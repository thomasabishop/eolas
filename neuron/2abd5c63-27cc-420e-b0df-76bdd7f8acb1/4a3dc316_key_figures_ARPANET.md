# 4a3dc316_key_figures_ARPANET

- [Paul Baran](385af4b4_Baran_distributed_networks.md) for his work at RAND on
  distributed networks as an alternative to the extant
  centralised/de-centralised phone networks.

- Donald Davies at the UK Physical Laboratory for developing ideas on
  #packet-switching, similar to but derived independently of Baran's work.

- Bob Kahn as the principle designer of the ARPANET, who with Vint Cerf, wrote
  the TCP/IP protocols. Became director of the Information Processing Techniques
  Office within ARPA/DARPA.

- Vint Cerf was head of the International Networking Group and worked on the
  Network Control Protocol (the first protocol for packet switching using the
  IMPs). Later joined up with Kahn on TCP/IP and the network of packet-switching
  networks (early internet).
