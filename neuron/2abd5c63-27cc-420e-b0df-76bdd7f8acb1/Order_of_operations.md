# Order of operations

1. Evaluate expressions in **parentheses**
1. Evaluate **exponents**
1. Evaluate **multiplications and divisions** from left to right in the order
   that they appear
1. Evaluate **additions and subtractions** from left to right in the order that
   they appear.

In the absence of grouping symbols, addition holds no precedence over
subtraction and vice versa.

```
15 - 8 + 4 = 7 + 4
					= 11
```

```
15 - 8 + 4 = 15 - 12
					 = 3
```
