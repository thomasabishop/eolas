# Defining a computer

> A general-purpose computer is one that, given the appropriate instructions and
> required time, should be able to perform most common computing tasks.

This sets a general purpose computer aside from a special-purpose computer, like
the one you might find in your dishwasher which may have its instructions
hardwired or coded into the machine. Special purpose computers only perform a
single set of tasks according to prewritten instructions. We’ll take the term
_computer_ to mean general purpose computer.

Simplified model of what a computer is:

Although the input, output and storage parts of a computer are very important,
they will not be the focus of this course. Instead we are going to learn all
about the process part, which will focus on how the computer is able to follow
instructions to make calculations.

- The abacus was created because the scale of society had become greater than
  what a single person could create and manipulate in their mind.
  - Eg thousands of people in a village and tens of thousands of cattle
- In a basic abacus each row of beads (say its coloured) represents a different
  power of ten
- As well as aiding calculation, the abacus acts as a primitive storage device
- Similar early computing devices: astrolabe, slide rule, sunrise clocks, tide
  clocks

- One of the first computers of the modern era was the Step Reckoner built by
  Leibniz in 1694.
  - In addition to adding, this machine was able to multiply and divide
    basically through hacks because from a mechanical point of view,
    multiplications and divisions are just many additions and subtractions
  - For example, to divide 17/5, we just subtract 5, then 5, then 5 again until
    we can't do anymore hence two left over
- But as these machines were expensive and slow, people used pre-computed tables
  in book form generated by human computers. Useful particularly for things like
  square roots.
- Similarly range tables were created that aided the military in calculating
  distances for gunboat artillery which factored in contextual factors like
  wind, drift, slope and elevation. These were used well into WW2 but they were
  limited to the particular type of cannon or shell

- Babbage sought to overcome this by designing the **Difference Engine** which
  was able to compute polynomials. Complex mathematical expressions that have
  constants, variables and exponent. He failed to complete it in his lifetime
  because of the complexity and number of intricate parts required. His model
  was eventually successfully created in the 90s using his designs and it
  worked.
  - But while he was coming up with this he also conceived of a better and
    general purpose computing device that wasn't limited to polynomial
    calculations → the Analytical Engine.
  - It could run operations in sequence and had memory and a primitive printer.
    It was way ahead of its time and was never completed.
  - Ada #Lovelace wrote hypothetical programs for the Analytical Engine, hence
    she is considered the world's first computer programmer.
- At this point then, computing was limited to scientific and engineering
  disciplines but in 1890, the US govt needed a computer in order to comply with
  the constitutional stipulation to have a census every ten years. This was
  getting increasingly difficult with the growing population - it would take
  more than 13 years to complete. This led to punch cards designed by Herman
  Hollereth. From this IBM was born
