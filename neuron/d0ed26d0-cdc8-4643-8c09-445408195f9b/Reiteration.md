# Reiteration

**Reiteration (R)** allows us to restate any proposition already in the proof
within the main proof or a more deeply nested sub-proof. Reiteration allows us
to reuse any assumptions, or propositions derived from assumptions, without
having to introduce a new dependency with another assumption.
