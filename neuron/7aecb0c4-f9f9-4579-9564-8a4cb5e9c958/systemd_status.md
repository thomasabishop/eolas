# Get status of a specific unit

Here I have requested the status of the currently running `mongodb` unit:

```
$ systemctl status mongod
mongodb.service - MongoDB Database Server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mongodb.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2022-08-17 07:25:27 BST; 24h ago
       Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
   Main PID: 931 (mongod)
     Memory: 304.1M
        CPU: 2min 18.630s
     CGroup: /system.slice/mongodb.service
             └─931 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf
Aug 17 07:25:27 archbish systemd[1]: Started MongoDB Database Server.****
```

In addition to the core info it tells us the unit type. In this case it is a
service.

We can also view the journal entry for the given unit. This provides you with
its diagnostic log messages:

```
journalctl --unit=mongodb.service

```

Each entry is organised around specific boots.
